# Memoreez 

=============
## About
Memoreez is an app created at the 2015 Static Showdown Hackathon on the weekend of January 24, 2015.

## The Story
Memoreez is a quick and easy way for family, friends and acquaintances to leave you pictures, contact information, and a personal message during, and even before an event. Just setup your event in Memoreez, and your guests can check in, take photos, and leave you a message on your computer (or their own devices via a provided link).  

After, and during the event everyone can view the memories in a timeline, and share them with others. Think of it as your digital guestbook that can be used at weddings, holiday parties, company events or anywhere you want. Creating a Memoreez event is as easy as entering the name of your event, your name, and an email address. Weâ€™ll do all the heavy lifting and set it up.  


## Technology

Here are some of the technologies, services, and tools we used to build Memoreez.

*   Divshot
*   AngularJS
*	Github
*   Firebase
*	Webflow
*	Starbucks
*	Zapier


## The Future
We worked hard to create a feature set that would ensure you'd never forget those special moments, but with the time restraints we weren't able to add accounts and authorization or video and that would be our next step.  

We have a list of functionality we'd like to add including (but not limited too) event scheduling, reception mode, and better sharing which would bring Memoreez to any even higher level of awesomeness.
